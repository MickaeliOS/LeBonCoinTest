# Leboncoin Technical Test

Welcome to my solution to the technical challenge presented by Leboncoin.

This application is designed to display a list of items and users can select any one to view its detailed information.
To assist in finding specific items, the list is sortable by category.

I chose the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for this project. This decision was driven by the clear separation of concerns MVVM offers, which lead to the creation of well structured applications.

My background is primarily in iOS development using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, so adopting MVVM also provided an excellent opportunity to expand my skills and tackle a new challenge.

To try out the application, simply clone the repository and run the project. There are no special setup requirements !
